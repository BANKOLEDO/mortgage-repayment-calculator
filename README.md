## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of input validation, DOM manipulation, and responsive design principles. Implementing features such as input cleaning and dynamic error handling in JavaScript was a great learning experience.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to explore more complex state management and perhaps introduce more interactive features using frameworks like React or Vue.js. I also plan to deepen my understanding of financial calculations to create more robust calculators.
